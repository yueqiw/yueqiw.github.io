I'm currently studying computer science at [Columbia University](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/) with a focus on machine learning. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in neuroscience from the [University of Utah](https://neuroscience.med.utah.edu/) under the guidance of [Alex Shcheglovitov](https://www.shcheglovitov.com). I grew up in Beijing and did my undergraduate studies at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/).
