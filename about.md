I'm currently a software engineer at Google. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. in neuroscience from the [University of Utah](https://neuroscience.med.utah.edu/) under the guidance of [Alex Shcheglovitov](http://shcheglovitov-lab.utah.edu/), and a M.S. in computer science at Columbia University. I grew up in Beijing and did my undergraduate studies at [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/).
